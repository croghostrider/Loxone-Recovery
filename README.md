# Loxone-Recovery
With this tool, you can recover the previous versions of the Loxone SPS program saved on the mini server.

Big thanks to Markus Fritze and his reverse engineering of the mini server,
the tool is based on this [script](https://github.com/sarnau/Inside-The-Loxone-Miniserver/blob/master/Code/loadMiniserverConfigurationFile.py).

# How-to
Connect with the Loxone Config to the mini server and create a backup.

Select the source and destination folder.
Normally you can find the backup under "\Documents\Loxone\Loxone Config\Backups".
Click on Start.
